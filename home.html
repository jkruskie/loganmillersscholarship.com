On the top of the list, was loading up on college classes while in high school so he could try to beat his big sister in getting his bachelor’s before she did. His goal has weighed heavily on our hearts as he will not have the opportunity to try anymore. </p><p>We aim to help someone else reach their goal by awarding $2,500 yearly to a local student in Logan’s honor. This award will remain until all funds have been depleted. </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Made with ❤️ by <a href="https://jkruskie.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J.
