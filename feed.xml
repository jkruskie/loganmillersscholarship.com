                <p>On the morning of Friday August 28th Logan Mills was hit by a car while running on the side of the road during cross country practice. He sustained severe internal injuries and was transported by ambulance to Mid-Michigan Medical Center in West Branch, Michigan. His mother and sister arrived at the hospital and by this time the Mid-Michigan team were fighting desperately to keep him alive. Logan flat-lined several times and had severe internal bleeding. We were lucky enough that the Mid-Michigan team was able to procure a trauma surgeon from Midland (about 45 mins away) to come up and work on Logan. The surgeon and rest of the medical team were able to stabilize him enough to transport him to Hurley Medical Center in Flint which was the nearest trauma center. Due to the weather that morning, helicopter transport was not possible, and Logan had to be driven. Upon arriving, Logan was barely alive. He fought hard, but his heart stopped and the team at Hurley was unable to get it started again.</p>
<p>Logan was determined and loved life. His smile was contagious, bright, and beautiful. He was looking forward to starting high school, running cross country, playing basketball, and singing in the school’s choir. Over the summer he had been working on his running and was looking forward to his first meet on September 3rd. He was very excited to have made varsity in his first year of running as a freshman. From the time Logan was a little boy he always had an iron will and had begun to focus his energy on his hopes and dreams. We had really started to see Logan blossom in the last year, starting the transition from boy to young man. He had been working for his aunt and uncle babysitting two of his young cousins through the summer and helped make firewood bundles for another aunt and uncle. He had managed to save enough money to buy a new iPhone, a year’s worth of phone service, and a super gawdy pair of SpongeBob SquarePants edition Nikes that fit his style and personality perfectly. As he would say, “aren’t they sexy.” He loved to laugh, make people smile, and had a robust sense of humor.  </p>
<p>Logan had a number of goals. On the top of the list, was loading up on college classes while in high school so he could try to beat his big sister in getting his bachelor’s before she did. His goal has weighed heavily on our hearts as he will not have the opportunity to try anymore. We decided to start a scholarship fund awarding $2,500 yearly to a local student in Logan’s honor for as long as we are alive or until funds run out. Any donations will go to this fund.</p>
